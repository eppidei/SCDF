SETUP PATHS NEEDED FOR PROJECT INDEXING

Android project's resources are indicated with paths relative to SCDF's trunk.
So, you need to define a variable named SCDF_TRUNK containing this path.
Go to "windows -> preferences -> General -> Workspace -> Linked Resources"
In the "Defined path variables" box, add a variable named SCDF_TRUNK.
Make it point to the location where your SCDF trunk is
