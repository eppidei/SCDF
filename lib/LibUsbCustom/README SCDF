Libusb code has been modified to work on android, adding a function
that accepts and already opened file descriptor for a usb device.

The code should work on other platforms as well, but the current config.h
file has been tweaked for android specifically. So if you plan to use
libusb on other platforms, generate config.h using the official methods
(you will need executables and other stuff not included in this repository,
download them from libusb site). 

In that case, please don't just override config.h, but discuss a solution with who's responsible for SCDF on android.
